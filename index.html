                <h1 class="heading">Website Design</h1>
                <p>Website design is the process of creating the visual layout and user interface of a website. It involves designing the overall look and feel of a website, as well as determining the best way to organize content and navigation for optimal user experience.
                   A good website design should be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and accessible to users of all abilities. It should also be responsive, meaning it can adjust to different screen sizes and devices, and optimized for fast loading speeds.</div>p

                <h1 class="heading">UX/UI Design</h1>
                <p>User experience (UX) design and user interface (UI) design are two related but distinct disciplines that are both essential to creating a successful digital product, such as a website or mobile app. UI design, on the other hand, is concerned with the visual and interactive aspects of a digital product. This includes designing the layout, typography, color scheme, and other visual elements that make up the product's user interface. UI designers are responsible for creating a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing design that supports the product's overall UX goals.</p>

                <h1 class="heading">Building App</h1>
                <p>Building an Android app involves designing, developing, testing, and publishing a software application for Android devices. The process begins with defining the app's purpose and features, planning its structure and user flow, and designing an intuitive user interface. The app is then developed using programming languages such as Java or Kotlin and integrated with the Android SDK. Testing is crucial to ensure the app works correctly, and it is free of bugs and glitches before it is published on the Google Play Store. After publication, the app needs to be maintained and updated regularly to fix bugs, add new features, or optimize performance.</p>
